			"expansionPrompt": "Generate 4–5 subtasks to perform a fast, read-only repository scan:\n- List contents of `docs/` and `editor/plugins/` (use ripgrep/rg) and capture notable files.\n- Open `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/tasks.md`, `docs/architecture.md` if present; summarize NL Scene Builder-relevant points.\n- Search for `editor/plugins/nl_scene_builder/*` and references in `editor/plugins/SCsub`.\n- Identify Godot version from `SConstruct` and `version.py` (e.g., 4.2/4.3).\n- Produce `docs/repo_scan.md` with explicit yes/no findings, Godot version, and implications for scaffolding.\nAcceptance: report exists with sources/commands noted; no code changes made.",
			"reasoning": "Pure discovery with grep and file reads; minimal risk and no code changes. Slight nuance in parsing build/version files and ensuring complete coverage justifies a small bump above trivial."

			"taskTitle": "Scaffold Minimal NL Scene Builder Editor Plugin (4 files)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate 6–8 subtasks to scaffold the minimal editor plugin without building:\n- Create `editor/plugins/nl_scene_builder/`.\n- Add `nl_scene_builder_plugin.h`: declare `class NLSceneBuilderPlugin : public EditorPlugin` with `GDCLASS`, an `EditorDock* dock` member, and ctor/dtor declarations.\n- Add `nl_scene_builder_plugin.cpp`: ctor creates an `EditorDock`, sets title \"NL Scene Builder\", sets a layout key \"nl_scene_builder\", adds a `VBoxContainer` with a `Label` \"NL Scene Builder (scaffold)\", and registers the dock using non-deprecated Godot 4.x APIs; dtor removes the dock and frees it.\n- Add `nl_scene_builder/SCsub`: clone `env`, prepend this folder to `CPPPATH`, and append `*.cpp` to `env.editor_sources`.\n- Update `editor/plugins/SCsub` to include `SConscript('nl_scene_builder/SCsub')` while preserving the existing top-level `*.cpp` build line.\n- Update `editor/register_editor_types.cpp` to include the plugin header and add `EditorPlugins::add_by_type<NLSceneBuilderPlugin>();` in alphabetical order.\n- Add static verification steps (grep) to confirm new include, `add_by_type` call, and `SConscript` entry.\nAcceptance: files exist with expected class/function signatures; grep checks pass; no build performed.",
			"reasoning": "Touches multiple engine/editor surfaces (C++ API, docks, SCons structure, registration). Non-deprecated API use and alphabetical registration add precision requirements. Static checks only reduce risk, but integration nuances keep complexity mid-high."

			"reasoning": "Full engine build is lengthy and environment-sensitive; runtime validation adds manual checks and troubleshooting. Platform variability and potential toolchain issues raise complexity."

			"reasoning": "Cross-cutting architecture across agents and artifacts; decisions must align with repo structure and constraints. No implementation yet, but requires clear contracts and sequencing across components."
